## Project 1. Quick Transfer Learning. 
https://github.com/martin-merener/deep_learning/tree/master/quick_transfer_learning

Use fastai library (https://docs.fast.ai/), built on top of pytorch, for transfer learning. Build with it four classifiers for image recognition: three of them binary and one with 12 categories (12 different kinds of sushi). The purpose of the project is: 
(i) show how fastai can be easily used to build quick models with good accuracy; (ii) build a demo web app with Zeit using the sushi classifier, which provides estimations of the kind of sushi present in an uploaded image.

## Project 2. More Challenging Transfer Learning. 
https://github.com/martin-merener/deep_learning/tree/master/more_transfer_learning

The purpose of this project is to show how to effectively do transfer learning (using fastai library) to solve classification problems with challenging and realistic datasets. This is achieved by showing very successful classification performances across 4 different datasets (publicly available).
In the first case, working with a dataset of 57,000 images of fruits which are classified into 83 different categories. The second dataset consists of 10,000 images of skin lesions, classified into 7 types of skin-cancer diagnoses. Then, 5,800 Chest X-Ray images for a binary classification into Pneumonia or Normal. Finally, a dataset of nearly 85,000 images of retinas, for classification into 4 categories (normal, and 3 diseases).
