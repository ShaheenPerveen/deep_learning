## Project 1. Quick Transfer Learning. 
https://github.com/martin-merener/deep_learning/tree/master/quick_transfer_learning

Use fastai library (https://docs.fast.ai/), built on top of pytorch, for transfer learning. Build with it four classifiers for image recognition: three of them binary and one with 12 categories (12 different kinds of sushi). The purpose of the project is: 
(i) show how fastai can be easily used to build quick models with good accuracy; (ii) build a demo web app with Zeit using the sushi classifier, which provides estimations of the kind of sushi present in an uploaded image.

## Project 2. More Challenging Transfer Learning.
